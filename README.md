  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

### `timesheets`
Individual clock-in/out/break records.
```js

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### Two-Layer Authentication System

The app implements a sophisticated two-layer authentication system:

**Layer 1: Device Authentication**
- Each kiosk device must be registered by an admin
- Device receives a JWT token stored in httpOnly cookie
- Middleware validates device token on every request
- Devices can be disabled or revoked remotely
- Device activity is tracked for security auditing

**Layer 2: Employee/User Authentication**
- Employees authenticate via 4-6 digit PIN
- Admins/users authenticate via username + password
- Separate JWT tokens for employee and admin sessions
- Automatic session expiration and logout
- Idle timeout protection (30s for employees)

### Roles & Permissions

| Role | Access Level |
|---|---|
| `super_admin` | Full system access, user management, all locations |
| `admin` | Dashboard access, employee management, timesheet editing |
| `user` | Limited dashboard access, view-only permissions |
| `employee` | Clock in/out only, view own timesheets |

### Security Features

- All passwords hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens with expiration
- httpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- Device fingerprinting and tracking
- Geofence validation for location-based access
- Automatic flagging of suspicious entries

---

## 📸 Cloudinary Integration

Images are uploaded directly from the client to Cloudinary using secure upload endpoints — no files pass through Vercel. The returned URL is stored in MongoDB.

### Used for:
- Employee profile photos (`employees.img`)
- Clock-in selfies (`timesheets.image`)

### Features:
- Automatic image optimization and compression
- Responsive image delivery
- Secure upload with validation
- Automated cleanup of unused images via cron job
- Folder organization (`timesheet/avatars`, `timesheet/clockins`)

```ts
// Upload flow
const formData = new FormData()
formData.append("file", blob, "clock.jpg")
const res = await fetch("/api/employee/upload/image", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
})
const { url } = await res.json()
// url is stored in MongoDB
```

### Cleanup Strategy
- Cron job runs periodically to identify orphaned images
- Compares Cloudinary assets with database references
- Safely deletes unused images to save storage
- Configurable via `/api/cron/cleanup-cloudinary`

---

## 🎯 Face Detection & Geofencing

### Real-time Face Detection
- Uses Human Library (@vladmandic/human) for client-side face detection
- Detects face presence and size before capturing photo
- Provides visual feedback (corner brackets, status indicators)
- Captures photo only when face is stable and properly sized
- Falls back gracefully if face not detected (flags entry)
- No blocking — employees can always clock in

### Geofencing
- GPS-based location validation for clock-ins
- Configurable radius per location (default 100m)
- Two modes:
  - **Hard mode**: Blocks clock-in if outside geofence
  - **Soft mode**: Allows clock-in but flags for review
- Automatic location detection and assignment
- Distance calculation to nearest approved location
- Geofence violations tracked in timesheet flags

## ⚡ Vercel Free Tier Considerations

| Constraint | How it's handled |
|---|---|
| 10s function timeout | All API routes are kept lightweight; no bulk processing in a single request |
| MongoDB connections | Connection caching in `lib/mongodb.ts` prevents pool exhaustion on serverless |
| No persistent file storage | All files go to Cloudinary directly — Vercel is stateless |
| 100GB bandwidth / month | Cloudinary serves all media; Next.js serves only JSON and HTML |

### MongoDB connection caching pattern
```ts
// lib/mongodb.ts
let cached = global.mongoose;
if (!cached) cached = global.mongoose = { conn: null, promise: null };

if (!cached.conn) {
  cached.promise = mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI!, {
    bufferCommands: false,
  });
  cached.conn = await cached.promise;
}
return cached.conn;
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone & install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sushilldhakal/Timesheet.git
cd Timesheet
npm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your values:
```env
# MongoDB Atlas connection URI
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/timesheet?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT secret for authentication (min 32 chars)
# Generate: openssl rand -hex 32
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here

# Cloudinary credentials (from Dashboard → API Keys)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_FOLDER=timesheet

# Optional: Cron job secret for cleanup endpoints
CRON_SECRET=your-random-secret
```

### 3. Setup face detection models
```bash
npm run setup:models
```

This copies the required Human library models from node_modules to public/models/.

### 4. Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 5. Initial setup
1. Visit the app — you'll see a setup dialog
2. Create your admin account (username + password)
3. Register your first device (kiosk)
4. Add employees via the dashboard
5. Employees can now clock in using their PIN

---

## 📋 Usage

### For Admins
1. Login at `/login` with your username and password
2. Access the dashboard to:
   - Manage employees (add, edit, delete)
   - View and edit timesheets
   - Review flagged entries
   - Manage devices
   - Configure categories (roles, locations, employers)
   - View analytics and reports

### For Employees
1. Visit the kiosk device (registered device)
2. Enter your 4-6 digit PIN
3. Allow camera and location permissions
4. Clock in/out or take breaks
5. Photo and location are captured automatically

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

### Environment Variables for Production
- Set all variables from `.env.example`
- Use strong JWT_SECRET (32+ characters)
- Configure MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
- Set up Cloudinary production credentials
- Optional: Configure CRON_SECRET for cleanup jobs
